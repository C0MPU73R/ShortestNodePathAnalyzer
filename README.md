# Shortest-Node-Path-Analyzer
Basic Tutorial:
So this program finds the shortest path given a number of locations. You always start at the x,y position 0,0 and end at the x,y position 0,0, no matter what.
When you enter your x,y coordinates they are automatically numbered from 1-"n", and the program will visit each and determine the shortest distance and which permutation was the shortest path.




You may use this program and it's code however you wish (reverse engineering, licensing etc...). It's Freeware.
Feel free to update and rebuild some methods if you wish. This is an early version of the program
